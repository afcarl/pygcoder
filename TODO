svg curve to line segments/arcs with some tolerance

use svg.path library for this (curve.point)

- take a curve/bezier
- try to fit it with a line/arc
- subdivide it and check if error > tolerance
- error < tolerance, return
- error > tolerance, subdivide sub-paths (recurse)
- check if minimum arc length is reached (too many subdivisions)

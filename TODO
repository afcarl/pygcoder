svg curve to line segments/arcs with some tolerance

use svg.path library for this (curve.point)

- take a curve/bezier
- try to fit it with a line/arc
- subdivide it and check if error > tolerance
- error < tolerance, return
- error > tolerance, subdivide sub-paths (recurse)
- check if minimum arc length is reached (too many subdivisions)


Currently working
- beginning of path processing (see tests/test_transform.py)
- work towards offsetting (see tests/test_split.py)

Needs
- test bezier offset
- get offset for lines & arcs
- get offset working (for kerf correction)
- get conversion from curves to lines working (for gcode generation)
- get clockwise/counterclockwise path rotation working (for cutter correction)
- gcode writer
- style evaluator
- options evalulator
